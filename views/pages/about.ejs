            <h3>Roman Sydoruk</h3>
            <p>I'm a future full stack developer, with a background in Law. I love to learn new things about coding and really inspired to create projects in web development. I'm interested in social projects aimed at preserving the environment, so I believe that the future is in electric cars. I'm happy with our project, because we spent about 2 weeks for that and each day learnt new technologies. My life credo is a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. I am a team player and really appreciate reliability and responsibility.</p>
