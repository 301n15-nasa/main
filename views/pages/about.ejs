              <h3>Roman Sydoruk</h3>
              <p>I'm a future full stack developer, with a background in Law. I love to learn new things about coding and really inspired to create projects in web development. I'm interested in social projects aimed at preserving the environment, so I believe that the future is in electric cars. I'm happy with our project, because we spent about 2 weeks for that and each day learnt new technologies. My life credo is a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. I am a team player and really appreciate reliability and responsibility.</p>

              <h3>Noah Rhodes</h3>
              <p>I have been in the digital marketing space since 2014, doing analytics and implementation work across many different industries. Recently, after listening to a Microsoft event where AI was being used to do things that very closely matched my job description, I became convinced that it was time to make a change to being the guy who builds the thing that automates my job away, rather than being on the recieving end. I spend my free time trying to wrap my brain around the fundamental structure of programming, hanging out with friends and playing with my laser collection.</p>
