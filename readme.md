## Overview
The initial goal of this project is to display some cool data on asteroids and comet arrivals using the NASA API.


## Getting Started
- To start, log to: https://are-we-screwed.herokuapp.com/
- Search asteroids by entering start and end dates. Note that the time interval doesn't have to exceed 7 days.
- You can also make a search by entering a location and radius to explore any present asteroids in the area.
- You can also have a look of a nice picture of the day from NASA!
